We are building the fastest growing platform for AI builders with over 5 million users & 100k organizations who collectively shared over 1M models, 300k datasets & 300k apps. Our open-source libraries have more than 400k+ stars on Github.\nAbout the RoleGradio is the most widely used library to build and share machine learning demos, with more than 6m monthly downloads on PYPI. It is maintained by the Gradio team within Hugging Face. We are currently working on a suite of AI tools to help users quickly understand and write Gradio code.The first is the Playground: a code editor on our website which can generate or update complete Gradio demos based on a user's query. The main objective for a Machine Learning Engineering intern will be to expand this effort. We can leverage :500k Gradio spaces and thousands of existing prompts from users to build a sophisticated model pipeline with the proper context of how Gradio works. More and more developers are relying on LLMs for assistance in writing code, but these LLMs often do not have proper context on how Gradio works. Gradio has evolved from a library to an ecosystem for machine learning developers, with custom components contributed from our community, Python and JS clients, and Gradio Lite. To advance these efforts and as Gradio's usage and developer community grows, it's important to invest in tools that can help users learn, build and contribute to Gradio.\nAbout YouYou're passionate about open source and making advanced ML tools accessible. You are someone who stays up to date with the latest machine learning trends and models. You love experimenting and have a high bias for action and results. Some of our requirements for this role : Experience using modern deep learning libraries and LLM APIs and understanding tradeoffs between different models and APIs Knowledge of how to fine-tune LLMs, create retrieval-augmented generation pipelines, and use re-rankers for two-stage retrieval You're comfortable exploring and contributing to a codebase consisting of Python and Svelte-flavored JavaScript You have a \"product mindset\" -- like experimenting with different user interfaces to build products that are useful to to hundreds of thousands of users  If you're interested in joining us, but don't tick every box above, we still encourage you to apply!

Reducto helps AI teams turn those really complex documents into LLM-ready inputs with exceptional accuracy. This means they can build more reliable products while saving engineering time.\n\nOur Traction\n\nHundreds of companies have signed up to use Reducto since our launch, and we're now processing tens of millions of pages every month for teams ranging from startups to Fortune 10 enterprises. We\u2019re hiring founding software engineers to help us continue to serve our customers as we build the ingestion layer that connects human data with LLMs.\n\nThe Opportunity\n\nAs a member of our founding team you\u2019ll work on our core API and on prem deployments. That means you\u2019ll have a hand in everything that our customers need.\n\nWe Would Love To Meet You If You\n\nPhilosophy: You are your own worst critic. You have a high bar for quality and don\u2019t rest until the job is done right\u2014no settling for 90%. We want someone who ships fast, with high agency, and who doesn't just voice problems but actively jumps in to fix them.Experience: You have 2 to 5 years of experience with training, fine tuning, and evaluating ML models used in production systemsLanguage/Skills: You\u2019re exceptional at Python or similar, and are well versed with both traditional computer vision and VLMsTools: Build your own tools as needed\u2014like a quick Streamlit app to test hypotheses or create a dataset.Approach: A quantitative approach to building products. Ability to debug, experiment, and iterate fast. You should be comfortable getting hands-on with the full development lifecycle, from ideation to shipping to users.\n\nThe Core Work Will Include\n\nTraining and deploying new state of the art models for parsing and interpreting unstructured dataExperimenting with novel techniques to improve LLM accuracyBuild data pipelines, evaluate model performance, and integrate models into the productWorking directly with the founders and customers to shape the product direction and engineering strategy\n\nBonus Points If You\n\nHave prior experience founding a company or building products at early stagesAre ambitious and driven, and care a lot about doing great work with great peopleKeep up with the latest developments in ML/AI\n\nThis is an in person role at our office in SF. We\u2019re an early stage company which means that the role requires working hard and moving quickly. Please only apply if that excites you.\n\nAbout Reducto\n\nNearly 80% of enterprise data is in unstructured formats like PDFs\n\nPDFs are the status quo for enterprise knowledge in nearly every industry. Insurance claims, financial statements, invoices, and health records are all stored in a structure that\u2019s simply impractical for use in digital workflows. This isn\u2019t an inconvenience\u2014it\u2019s a critical bottleneck that leads to dozens of wasted hours every week.\n\nTraditional approaches fail at reliably extracting information in complex PDFs\n\nOCR and even more sophisticated ML approaches work for simple text documents but are unreliable for anything more complex. Text from different columns are jumbled together, figures are ignored, and tables are a nightmare to get right. Overcoming this usually requires a large engineering effort dedicated to building specialized pipelines for every document type you work with.\n\nReducto Breaks Document Layouts Into Subsections And Then Contextually Parses Each Depending On The Type Of Content. This Is Made Possible By a Combination Of Vision Models, LLMs, And a Suite Of Heuristics We Built Over Time.

This enhancement could be exploratory work based off of a performance need or directed work based off of ideas that other data science team members propose.Machine Learning Tools: The ML Engineer would build a tool for a specific project, or multiple projects though generally these types of projects are decoupled from any one project. The goal of this type of use case would be to ease a pain point in the data science process. This may involve speeding up training, making a data processing easier, or data management tooling.\n\nQualifications\n\nBS, MS, or PhD degree in Computer Science or related field, or equivalent practical experience.Knowledgeable with Data Science tools and frameworks (i.e. Python, Scikit, NLTK, Numpy, Pandas, TensorFlow, Keras, R, Spark). Basic knowledge of machine learning techniques (i.e. classification, regression, and clustering).\n\nHow you will lead\n\nDiscover data sources, get access to them, import them, clean them up, and make them \u201cmachine learning ready\u201d.Work with data scientists to create and refine features from the underlying data and build pipelines to train and deploy models.Partner with data scientists to understand, implement, refine and design machine learning and other algorithms.Run regular A/B tests, gather data, perform statistical analysis, draw conclusions on the impact of your models.Work cross functionally with product managers, data scientists and product engineers, and communicate results to peers and leaders.Explore new technology shifts in order to determine how they might connect with the customer benefits we wish to deliver.\n\nIntuit provides a competitive compensation package with a strong pay for performance rewards approach.
